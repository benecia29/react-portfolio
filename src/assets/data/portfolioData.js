Upon the user's verbal command, JARVIS (Yes, the one from Marvel XD) can send these user prompts, receive responses from the OpenAI API and display the results while also reading it out loud. It has access to the camera and microphone. It also has error handling functionalities so the user has a smooth experience. JARVIS is designed in a way that it can maintain the conversational flow (i.e. remember the previous queries). It can also write programs and save the file into a folder implementing file writing.",

After the admin logs in, there is also a functionality which allows to generate a pdf of the current page to view the users and the content, only for the admin. The admin can also delete the users and their content. Once logged out, the website will redirect to a beautifully designed home page. ",

This dynamic system comprises three fundamental components: User, Order, and Product, each corresponding to collections within the MongoDB database. Leveraging the power of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, users can seamlessly interact with and manage data within these entities. With a focus on security and seamless authentication, Bcrypt.js ensures encrypted password storage, while JWT facilitates secure user sessions. The integration of Thunder Client streamlines API testing, allowing for a smooth and reliable development experience.",
